# GOAL: Naive Bayes
This project was created and programmed for one of my university projects. The project uses Python and Scikit.

### Project: Create a part of a Search Engine
From a limited dataset of our choice, the program uses the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm for text classification of
our datasets, 
The dataset values and documents were analyzed, then using Feature Extraction, were categorized into a document-term matrix
A Gaussian model is created using Scikit and the model is trained on our limited datasets
Lastly, the model predicts a response from the test dataset and gives a prediction score
