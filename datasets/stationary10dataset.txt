Top 22 Best Mechanical Pencils – Luxury Lead Writing Utensils

    Next Luxury / Lifestyle — by Brian Cornwell

Any designer, artist, academic, engineer, or diligent notebook-keeper will lay claim to the importance of a good EDC (every day carry) mechanical pencil. Pens simply won’t cut it in the above categories, as ink leaves very little room for error, to say nothing of the potential mess. Save the ink pen for its proper use, and savor the convenience of a superior quality mechanical pencil.

When choosing a mechanical pencil there are several things to keep in mind. For starters, touch, weight, and balance are arguably the most important factors when it comes to a mechanical pencil’s must-haves. The heavier the pencil, the looser the grip, resulting in less writing fatigue. Heavier pencils also provide significantly more balance, and thus a steadier flow. True mechanical pencil enthusiasts can’t stress the importance of advance precision enough–in other words, how evenly the pencil produces lead. The more precise the pen’s advance, the more consistent the lead rate will be.

Last but far from least, lead width and hardness should be taken into account. While most mechanical pencils will accept lead of almost any size, with a number of high-end brands even featuring an indicator of which type of lead has been loaded, it’s worth taking note of the chosen lead width to avoid damagaging the pencil or producing lines that are broader or thinner than desired.

Overall, the best mechanical pencils are lightweight, easy to grip, and maintain a strong, smooth line. Whether you’re scribbling notes or rendering a painstaking drawing, you’ll want a mechanical pencil that holds up to–if not surpasses–the designated task at hand. Depending on your lead thickness preference, there are a number of mechanical pencils designed for specific projects and drafting sources. Available in materials ranging from polycarbonate makrolon (a high-grade plastic) to sleek metal, you’ll have no shortage of designs and brands to choose from.

Mechanical pencils are just one of life’s subtle tools, and easy to take for granted. For the true pros, however, a task-targeted and personalized mechanical pencil is the thinking man’s weapon of choice.
