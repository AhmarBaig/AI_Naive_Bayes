You can trust Cello blindly during your exams, as it won’t dry out or stop working and leave you in a state of disaster.

With Cello Technotip, you will not experience this situation as the pen provides a beautiful ink color from the beginning itself. The Lubriflow ink system makes the ink flow from the pen smoothly without giving any stains on the paper or your hand, unlike “use and throw” pens, which leaves the paper as well as your hand full of ink marks.
