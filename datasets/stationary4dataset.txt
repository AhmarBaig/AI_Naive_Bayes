Main types of luxury pens

When looking for a luxury pen, there is no other better way to start the search than by considering which kind of pen do you want to have. Majorly, there are three basic varieties of luxury pen you can consider – rollerballs, ballpoints and fountain pens. The most luxury one clearly is the fountain pen, and that’s because of the fact that it utilizes a metal nib, is usually made out of solid gold, contains an internal ink supply mechanism through replaceable catridges, a built-in internal reservoir, and a refillable converter. All these attributes offer the elegance and sophistication in the writing process. And for the buyers who are looking for all these attributes in their luxury pen, fountain pen should certainly be their pick. Apart from this, these days several luxury writing tools are made out of ballpoint variant also, which come with replaceable refills. They offer a convenience of click-top action or a twist, making the tool a perfect choice for all those who need something active, on-the-go types. Rollerball pens, on the other hand, provider greater level of smoothness to the writing, and just like the ballpoints, they come with disposable refills.

Balancing quality and price

Luxury pens can be quite expensive but last for many years – if not for a lifetime. The fountain pens normally priceTop 15 Best Luxury Pens in 2018 in the mid-$100 range, and you can get some of the entry level fountain pens for this amount. But some highly luxury ones even cost thousands of dollars, making them a tool for elite writing. So, there is entire spectrum that they are available in. Also, check how it balances at the time of writing. Hold it in the crook of your index finger and thumb and hold it lightly. Try writing and see if it exerts any kind of weight towards the ends of the pen. If it comes with a cap, it is supposed to be secured to the back for balancing act. The idea is the pen should be comfortable to be used – whether light or heavy, it should be able to maintain the overall balance. We have also written a complete guide about the best parker pens.

Material

Another factor to consider while choosing a luxury pen is the material used to make the barrel and the cap. While various good quality tools use high quality resins, which is a perfect sign of high end luxury pen, the use of hard-worked material such as celluloid, metal or ebonite hard rubber is what gives it the perfect touch. Ebonite hard rubber is a great material for making luxury pens and there are several vintage pens that are made using this material. The high quality celluloid comes with a long history associated to it, and it remains the icon of specialty to the elite manufacturers. Wooden pens have their own story, and these days even the metal – silver and gold pens are available for affordable prices.

Finish and Trim

As there is a great variety of luxury pens available in the market today, people look at the finish as one of the criteria to choose their pen. But whether you are inclined towards the luxury engraved metal ones or the colorful plastics, you must always check the finish of then pen for quality. The pattern given to the pen should align well on the barrel and cap when it has to be closed. To check for rough edges and stubborn burrs, run your fingers along the length of the pen. Also, understand the fact that the celluloid and acrylic finish would look the same to your untrained eye but celluloid requires more specific manufacturing techniques.
